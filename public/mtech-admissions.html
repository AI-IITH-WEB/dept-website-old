                                    department at IIT Hyderabad. Considering the
                                    interdisciplinary nature of AI, a separate
                                    department helps create a complete ecosystem
                                    for AI Academics and Research at IIT
                                    Hyderabad. The department offers B.Tech. and
                                    M.Tech. programs, and a variety of Minor
                                    Programs in AI. The emergence of the
                                    department is the consequence of the heavy
                                    demand from the industry for data analytics
                                    and the need to tackle the many fundamental
                                    and foundational research problems arising
                                    in a rapidly evolving field. The
                                    department's mission is to

                    Students who join the M.Tech (2-year) TA program will be
                    paid a stipend (as per the MoE norms) against their service
                    as teaching assistants (TA) to different course instructors.
                    The typical TA tasks include exam invigilation, supervising
                    undergraduate lab experiments, helping with course-related
                    activities, etc. Typically, 8 hours of TA service per week
                    is expected from a student.

                    program (ACM). After the success of the ACM program, the
                    institute has further revamped it to a Self-sponsored M.Tech
                    program to bring it to par with the regular M.Tech Program
                    to benefit the students. The Department of AI started
                    offering the ACM program in 2019-2020 and is offering the
                    revamped self-sponsored M.Tech program in Artificial
                    Intelligence and Machine Learning for the session 2020-21.

                    <b>Thesis:</b> Students will work with supervisor(s) to
                    contribute to high-quality research in AI.

                    Students who join the 3-year program will be assigned a
                    supervisor at the time of joining. Students admitted to the
                    regular M-Tech 3-year program are responsible for providing
                    research and teaching assistance to the supervisor. The
                    advantage of the regular 3-year MTech programm is that the
                    students can get better exposure to research under the
                    particular program. Students may be paid a stipend similar
                    to (or higher) than the 2-year MTech students.

                <h4 class="bold">Eligibility Criteria for Application</h4>
                <p>
                    The applicant must have earned (at least, should be in the
                    final year of the respective studies) a BTech/BE/Equivalent
                    degree in CS/EC/EE/AI/DS or MSc (Math/Stats/Applied Math).
                    Note that AI refers to the “Artificial Intelligence” branch,
                    and DS refers to the “Data Science” branch. In the latter
                    case, it would be assumed that the candidate can complete
                    the degree by the time of MTech admission. There are three
                    modes of admission to the MTech (3-year, RA) program.

                <h4 class="bold">Selection Process</h4>
                <p>
                    For admission to the program through any mode, there will be
                    a preliminary shortlisting depending on the academic
                    background and/ or GATE score. Candidate who satisfy the
                    shortlisting cutoff may need to appear for a written test
                    and/ or an interview. The decision to hold the
                    test/interview will be taken based on the number of
                    applications and communicated to the candidates at the
                    appropriate time. In addition, the department reserves the
                    right to set any cutoff for the shortlisting of MTech
                    applications. The department cannot select anybody if no
                    appropriate candidate are found. Note that mere eligibility
                    does not imply that the candidate will be shortlisted or
                    called for the written test/interview.
